We planned on making Plexity open source, but people didn’t want that at all. We voted on it multiple times in the Discord server, but it seems like “no” always got more votes, lol. But yeah, if you want to test it for any viruses, feel free to—because it’s not one. I never planned to make it a virus, ever.
